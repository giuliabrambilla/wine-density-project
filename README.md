# White Wine Density Prediction

## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook kernel exercise uses Simple and Multi-Linear Regression techniques to predict density indicator in white wine.


## Business Case
John is the CEO of a winery located in Vilafranca del Pened√©s. He has contacted you because has to perform a lot of analysis to each variety of wine. Among the measurements, the one related to wine density it's extremely slow: it takes more than one day per sample. He has contacted you because he wants to know whether it could be possible to build a mathematical model in order to quantify this specific variable on new samples, considering other features from each wine. Building a model that may fit his interest will have important consecuencies for his business: he will save time and, eventually, money.
